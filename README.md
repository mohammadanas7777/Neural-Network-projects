# Neural-Network-projects
This repository features implementations of ANN, CNN, and RNN models using PyTorch. Projects cover data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment, showcasing applications in regression, classification, and sequence modeling.

# Projects name and their description
NYC_taxi-data_EDA_ANN: This project implements an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) in PyTorch to estimate taxi fares in New York City based on trip details. The model takes both continuous features (e.g., 'pickup_longitude', 'pickup_latitude', 'dropoff_longitude', 'dropoff_latitude', 'passenger_count') and categorical features as inputs.
NYC_taxi-data_EDA_ANN-Classification: This project implements an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) in PyTorch to describe whether the predicted fare amount will be greater than 10 dollar or not, based on trip details in New York City. The model takes both continuous features (e.g., 'pickup_longitude', 'pickup_latitude', 'dropoff_longitude', 'dropoff_latitude', 'passenger_count') and categorical features as inputs. 'fare_class' column basically defines whether or not the fare amount is greater than $10.
